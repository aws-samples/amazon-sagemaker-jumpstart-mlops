## In this Project ,we demonstrate how to create a MLOps pipeline with Jumpstart

This blog post focuses on how we can implement MLOps with SageMaker JumpStart models using JumpStart APIâ€™s, SageMaker Pipelines (https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/) and SageMaker Projects (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-whatis.html). We show how to build an end to end CI/CD pipeline for data pre-processing, fine-tuning ML models, registering model artifacts to SageMaker Model Registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry.html), and automating model deployment with manual approval to stage and production. We will demonstrate a customer churn classification example using LightGBM model from Jumpstart.
